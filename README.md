# Change-Background-Color
Change-Background-Color is a project built using Html,CSS and JavaScript.
It changes the background color using RGB format when someone clicks on the button appeared on the screen. 
It also displays the corresponding RGB Color values.
As the JS and Css code was of few lines therefore i had not created separate JS and Css files.
